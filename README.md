# SteamScraper
## Summary
This program uses the Steamworks API to retrieve a list of reviews of a steam game given the app ID. These reviews are run through the RoBERTa natural language processing model
for sentiment analysis. The model produces sentiment scores for each review, and the scores are averaged and plotted in a distribution for analysis.
